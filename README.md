# Week 3 - Introduction to C programming

## C programming tools

C code has the extension .c

We require a compiler to convert the plain-text, source-code (.c) file to an executable

We will use the GNU Compiler Collection C compiler - gcc

The [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is a much bigger project, supporting many languages including C

Instructions on basic use of gcc are provided in the lectures.

## C programming references

There are a lot of online resources and you can find answers to most simple questions with a quick search.

For a more thorough introduction we would recommend the book:
- **Programming in C** by Stephen Kochan.
- Available in the [university library](https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991012350779705181&context=L&vid=44LEE_INST:VU1&lang=en&search_scope=My_Inst_CI_not_ebsco&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=AlmostEverything&query=any,contains,kochan%20c%20programming&offset=0) as an online book and in print
